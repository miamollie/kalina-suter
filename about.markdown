Raised on horseback in the mountains, Kalina’s fascination with movement took root at an early age, spending time trick riding, and dancing in a youth performance group. Cultivating her hunger for the creative, she pursued contemporary dance, ballet, and physical theater in the USA, Switzerland and the UK. She discovered circus in 2009 at All or Nothing Aerial Dance in Edinburgh, Scotland from which point there was no looking back.

In 2011 she studied at Rogelio Rivel in Barcelona, Spain, and graduated in 2014 from The New England Center for Circus Arts Professional Training Program in Vermont, USA. Kalina’s main passion and specialization is in single point trapeze and other skills include lyra, duo lyra, Spanish web, fabric, and contemporary Dance. Tantalized by the possibilities of movement and technical exploration, her style and expertise are ever evolving.

Along with performing, Kalina has a keen interest in biomechanics and Ideokinesis, incorporating these approaches into her training and as an instructor. She is currently completing her Pilates instructor certification and continues to seek out new ways of working with the body and blend them with her work in circus.
