A seabird and wolf child at heart, Kalina draws upon her instinctive nature in her creative style and movement. Raised on horseback in the mountains, her fascination with movement took root at an early age, while spending her time trick riding, dancing, and climbing trees. Cultivating a hunger for the creative, she pursued contemporary dance, ballet, and physical theater in the USA, Switzerland and the UK. 
She discovered circus in 2009 at All or Nothing Aerial Dance Theater in Edinburgh, Scotland. In 2011 she studied at Rogelio Rivel Circus School in Barcelona, Spain, and graduated in 2014 from The New England Center for Circus Arts Professional Training Program in Vermont, USA. Kalinaâ€™s main passion and specialty is Dance Trapeze, her other skills included Lyra (Duo and solo), aerial fabric, and corde lisse.
